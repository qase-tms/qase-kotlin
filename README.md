# [Qase TestOps](https://qase.io) reporters for Kotlin

Monorepo with [Qase TestOps](https://qase.io) reporters for Kotlin testing frameworks.

For all of our reporters, there are two versions:

* The latest v1 series, either already released or in the beta stage.

If you're just starting, pick v1.

| Name                      | Package name              | v1 series                                                                                      |

| **Qase Kotlin Reporters** |
| Kaspresso                 | `qase-kaspresso-reporter` | [âœ… released](https://github.com/qase-tms/qase-kotlin/tree/main/qase-kaspresso-reporter#readme) |  

What each status means:

* The "âœ… released" reporters are stable and well-tested versions.
  They will receive more new features as well as bugfixes, should we find bugs.

* The "ðŸ§ª open beta" reporters are in active development and rigorous testing.
  It's completely usable, but there can be some bugs and minor syntax changes.
  When starting a new test project, the "ðŸ§ª open beta" versions are the recommended choice.
  For existing projects, we recommend planning a migration â€” see the migration section in each
  reporter's readme and try out the new features.

* The "ðŸ§° closed beta" reporters are in active development, and
  can still have major bugs and future syntax changes.
  However, we encourage experimenting with them.
  Your feedback is always welcome.

* The v3 series reporters in the "ðŸ—¿stable" or "ðŸ—¿deprecated" status only get some fixes, but no new features.
